<p>
I'm a High school student at Stone Bridge in VA who has self-taught myself programming and has a passion for ML/AI. Currently an intern at BoodleAI where I am working on a recommendation engine to help non-profits raise more money. I also enjoy doing AI research and hope to do more in the future, especially in college. I am especially intrested in computer vison partly because it has such broad applications and honestly it is just kinda cool. </p>
