# CS231n (Fall 2017 - present) http://cs231n.stanford.edu/

To be clear I am not offcially taking this class nor am I a student of Stanford. I am using the lectures and assignments which are provided  online for Free. 

I am using the Spring 2017 version (future iterations of the class will be diffrent)

In this class you make and implement:

* K nearest neighbor
* Linear SVM
* Softmax Classifier
* Two-layer neural network
* N-layer neural network with diffrent update models, batch normalization, and dropout
* Convolutional Neural Nework
* Neural Network using Tensorflow
* RNN using Tensorflow
* LSTM with Tensorflow
* Style transfer network using Tensorflow
* GAN using Tensorflow
