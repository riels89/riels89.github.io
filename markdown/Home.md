I'm a freshman student at James Madison University in VA who has self-taught myself programming and has a passion for ML/AI. Currently an intern at BoodleAI where I am working on a recommendation engine to help non-profits raise more money. I am currently doing research into code authorship detection with the hope that we can use it to fight malware.
